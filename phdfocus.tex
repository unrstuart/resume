The focus of my Ph.D. work is on GPU computing and architecting new mechanisms, APIs, and programming models. In  particular, I focus on methods to make the GPU a first-class primitive for scientific computing, gaming applications, and eventually general purpose computing. In a broader sense, my work encompasses heterogeneous computing. I've also been to known to play with realistic rendering and scientific visualization.
