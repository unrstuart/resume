The focus of my Ph.D. work is on multi-CPU, multi-GPU clusters. In  particular,
I am focusing on methods to make the GPU a first-class primitive for scientific
computing, gaming applications, and eventually  general purpose computing. In a
broader sense, my work encompasses heterogeneous computing and strives to push
the technology and  understanding to as high a level as possible.
